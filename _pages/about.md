I am a PhD Student in the school of Computer Science at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/).
I am advised by [Prof. Hyesoon Kim](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/fac/hyesoon) and was also priviledged to have worked under [Prof. Sudakar Yalamanchili](https://www.microarch.org/sudha.html). My research interests are in the area of hardware accelerators and software co-design, focusing in the architecture design, programming languages and compiler tools to support heterogenous computing. I'm also interested in domain-specific applications of accelerators such as 3D graphics, graphs analytics, and machine learning. 

I have a strong passion for teaching and doing research that promotes the accessibility and democratization of scientific knowlegde for the masses, contributing in several open-source projects and initiatives.

Prior to pursing my graduate eduction, I was fortunate to have had a long industry experience working on compilers, language, and simulation tools for graphics processors at Microsoft, playing at the intersection between the application developer, the operating system, and hardware. I also had the privilege to intern at many prestigious reseach groups including [Catapult Project](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/project-catapult/) at Microsoft Reseach, Hardware Accelerator Research Program (HARP) at [Intel Labs](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/research/overview.html), Storage Systems Group at [IBM Alamaden Research](https://research.ibm.com/labs/almaden/), [Future Technologies group](https://www.ornl.gov/group/ft) at Oak Ridge Labs, [High-Performance Computing group](https://www.pnnl.gov/high-performance-computing) at Pacific Northwest Labs.
