Vortex is an open-source full-system GPU framework.

It integrates a detailed microarchitecture of a multicore GPU pipeline optimized for high-speed FPGAs.
The framework includes a compiler and runtime software stack to support parallel applications.
To support design-space exploration, the framework also provides a cycle-level simulation of the GPU.
