CocoGL is an OpenGL ES 1.0/1.1 3D graphics software emulator for Windows and Linux. 

The emulator accelerates 3D rasterization using template meta-programming where the graphics shader and the rendering pipeline are merged together and compiled statically to provide optimal runtime performance on the target platform.
