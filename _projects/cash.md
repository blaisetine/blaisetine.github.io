Cash is a C++ embedded domain specific library (EDSL) for hardware design and simulation. 

It uses template metaprogramming and macro-based reflection to extend the C++ language with hardware specific constructs. Cash enables developpers to describe and simulate their hardware designs in a single source program, leveraging the large ecosystem of C++ development tools and libraries.
